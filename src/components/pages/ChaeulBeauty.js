          <p>
            The client, a cosmetic tattoo artist, initially relied solely on
            Instagram DMs to manage bookings. To improve professionalism and
            accessibility, I designed a website with multilingual support and
            calendar-based booking. However, real-world usage revealed
            unexpected friction.

          <h2>5. Design Process</h2>

          <p>
            I began with a booking-first flow: clients could choose a date,
            select services, and confirm via calendar. It seemed efficient ‚Äî but
            real users wanted something different.
          </p>

          <p>
            Post-launch research showed that users valued personal, trust-based
            consultations over speed. KakaoTalk was already their go-to tool for
            real-time, friendly communication.
          </p>

          <p>
            So I redesigned the experience: removed the calendar system,
            simplified the flow, and added a clear CTA to start a KakaoTalk
            consultation ‚Äî aligning with what both the artist and clients
            actually preferred.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also redesigned the landing page to reflect Chaeul Beauty‚Äôs tone:
            calm, elegant, and service-oriented. Instead of generic images, the
            new layout shows categorized post-treatment results, helping users
            explore by their needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Previously, the landing featured the founder's portrait and studio
            photos ‚Äî meaningful, but distracting. I moved that content to a new{" "}
            <strong>About</strong> page to improve focus. Now, the landing
            highlights services and results, while the About page tells the
            brand story and introduces the space more intentionally.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="case-block">
          <h2>6. Brand Identity & Logo Design</h2>
          <p>
            In the original version, the logo was provided by the client, and my
            focus remained on layout and user flow. However, during the
            redesign, I took the opportunity to elevate the brand by creating a
            new logo that better reflects the studio‚Äôs values and aesthetic.
          </p>

            className="logo-image"
          />
          <p className="logo-description">
            The Chaeul Beauty logo is inspired by the Chinese character ‚ÄòÁæé
            (Mi)‚Äô, meaning beauty, reimagined in the abstract form of a
            blossoming flower. Flowers are a timeless symbol of beauty, and
            here, the flower sits at the center of the design to represent
            elegance and harmony. The surrounding circular frame reflects the
            word ‚ÄòChaeul (Ï±ÑÏö∏)‚Äô, which means "to fill" or "to complete" in
            Korean. Together, the logo conveys the philosophy of filling life
            with beauty, both inside and out. This elegant and minimal design
            captures the essence of refined natural beauty, aligning with the
            brand‚Äôs identify and the brand name.

            The redesigned version emphasizes high-quality visuals, multilingual

            resonance over functionality, aligned more closely with the client's

//         <p>
//           The client, a beauty tattoo artist, needed a website that reflected
//           the elegance and professionalism of her work while also making it easy
//           for potential clients to learn about services, view past work, and
//           book appointments. Her existing online presence‚Äîlimited to
//           Instagram‚Äîmade it difficult for users to find consistent information,
//           trust the quality of the services, or take meaningful action.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           One key challenge was accessibility for international or
//           non-Korean-speaking clients. Without multilingual support, many
//           potential customers couldn't fully understand the content or navigate
//           the booking process. To address this, I implemented{" "}
//           <strong>a language switcher </strong>to allow foreign users to easily
//           access content in their preferred language, significantly improving
//           inclusivity.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           The overarching design goal was to create a site that was visually
//           striking, intuitive to navigate, and built with the full user journey
//           in mind‚Äîfrom discovery to booking‚Äîregardless of language barriers.

//           18 respondents who had experience with cosmetic tattooing. I also
//           performed competitor analysis to identify the strengths and weaknesses

          </p>
          <p>
            I designed and developed the original website to support booking,
            portfolio browsing, and multilingual access. Later, the client
            requested a redesign that removed booking and emphasized elegance,
            trust, and simplicity.

        </div>

        <div className="case-block">
          <h2>2. Project Background</h2>
          <p>
            I originally designed and developed the Chaeul Beauty website to
            help the client establish a professional digital presence beyond
            Instagram. The goal was to showcase her cosmetic tattoo work, enable
            seamless online booking, and accommodate international clients
            through multilingual support.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first version of the site included a full booking system, a
            dynamic portfolio, and a language switcher to serve both local and
            global audiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            After launching and observing user behavior for several months, the
            client realized a different approach would be more effective. Many
            users preferred consulting via KakaoTalk before booking, and
            automated scheduling led to frequent no-shows. Based on this, she
            requested a streamlined redesign that prioritized trust,
            conversation, and elegance over automation.

            reserve appointments directly through the site.

          <h2>3. Why the Redesign?</h2>
          <p>
            After launching the original site, we tracked user engagement and
            gathered feedback over several months. While the on-site booking
            system worked as intended, it became clear that it wasn't the ideal
            solution for this specific business.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>User behavior:</strong> Most clients still preferred to
              book or consult through <em>KakaoTalk</em>, as it offered
              real-time communication and felt more personal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Operational issues:</strong> The automated booking system
              led to an increase in no-shows, as users could book without any
              prior conversation or commitment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Client pain points:</strong> Managing and updating
              availability via a calendar system became a time-consuming task
              for the artist, who preferred to screen each client individually.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The original goal of convenience for both sides inadvertently
            created friction. Based on this insight, we pivoted the site‚Äôs
            purpose:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Remove the booking feature to reduce no-shows and increase quality
              interactions
            </li>
            <li>
              Emphasize <strong>brand aesthetics</strong>, past work, and a
              clear value proposition
            </li>
            <li>
              Guide users toward direct messaging through{" "}
              <strong>KakaoTalk</strong>‚Äîthe channel the artist trusted most
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The redesign shifted the website from a utility-first product into a
            brand-centered experience that builds trust before any appointment
            is booked.

            In the original version, the logo was provided by the client, and my
            focus remained on layout and user flow. However, during the
            redesign, I took the opportunity to elevate the brand by creating a
            new logo that better reflects the studio‚Äôs values and aesthetic.

          <p className="logo-description">
            The Chaeul Beauty logo is inspired by the Chinese character ‚ÄòÁæé
            (Mi)‚Äô, meaning beauty, reimagined in the abstract form of a
            blossoming flower. Flowers are a timeless symbol of beauty, and
            here, the flower sits at the center of the design to represent
            elegance and harmony. The surrounding circular frame reflects the
            word ‚ÄòChaeul (Ï±ÑÏö∏)‚Äô, which means "to fill" or "to complete" in
            Korean. Together, the logo conveys the philosophy of filling life
            with beauty, both inside and out. This elegant and minimal design
            captures the essence of refined natural beauty, aligning with the
            brand‚Äôs identify and the brand name.

            integration for easy consultations. Compared to the first iteration,
            this version emphasizes emotional resonance over functionality,
            aligned more closely with the client's evolved goals.

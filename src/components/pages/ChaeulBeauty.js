        <h2 className="section-title">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          The client, a beauty tattoo artist, needed a website that reflected
          the elegance and professionalism of her work while also making it easy
          for potential clients to learn about services, view past work, and
          book appointments. Her existing online presence‚Äîlimited to
          Instagram‚Äîmade it difficult for users to find consistent information,
          trust the quality of the services, or take meaningful action.
        </p>
        <p>
          One key challenge was accessibility for international or
          non-Korean-speaking clients. Without multilingual support, many
          potential customers couldn't fully understand the content or navigate
          the booking process. To address this, I implemented{" "}
          <strong>a language switcher </strong>to allow foreign users to easily
          access content in their preferred language, significantly improving
          inclusivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The overarching design goal was to create a site that was visually
          striking, intuitive to navigate, and built with the full user journey
          in mind‚Äîfrom discovery to booking‚Äîregardless of language barriers.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="case-study-section research">
        <h2 className="section-title">User Research</h2>
        <p>
          To gain insights into potential users, I conducted qualitative
          interviews with 5 clients of the artist and a short online survey with
          18 respondents who had experience with cosmetic tattooing. I also
          performed competitor analysis to identify the strengths and weaknesses
          of similar platforms.

            After gathering insights from research, I started designing
            wireframes that would simplify the user journey. The goal was to
            create a clean, user-friendly interface that highlights her
            portfolio while emphasizing easy navigation for booking
            appointments.

            The Chaeul Beauty logo is inspired by the Chinese character ‚ÄòÁæé
            (Mi)‚Äô, meaning beauty, reimagined in the abstract form of a
            blossoming flower. Flowers are a timeless symbol of beauty, and
            here, the flower sits at the center of the design to represent
            elegance and harmony. The surrounding circular frame reflects the
            word ‚ÄòChaeul (Ï±ÑÏö∏)‚Äô, which means "to fill" or "to complete" in
            Korean. Together, the logo conveys the philosophy of filling life
            with beauty, both inside and out. This elegant and minimal design
            captures the essence of refined natural beauty, aligning with the
            brand‚Äôs core mission.

            As a long-time H&M app user, I noticed consistent frustration with
            recent updates. I decided to redesign the app using a Design
            Thinking process after reading hundreds of user reviews and
            experiencing these issues myself.

          <p>
            Through this redesign, I learned how critical real user voices are
            to digital product decisions. Users want more than aesthetics ‚Äî they
            want confidence, clarity, and relatability. My final design centered
            around building that trust while keeping the interface clean and
            familiar.
